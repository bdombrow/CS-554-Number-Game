Mode 1:
	Multiply is not going to make sense with single digit numbers.
	How does the game end?
		Time?
	Can the numbers be reused in other equations?
		2 + 3 = 5
		5 - 3 = 2
		5 - 2 = 3
	Scoring:
		The example is worth 5 points.
			How is that determined?
			I would like to do something that favors harder math
				i.e. multiplication is worth more than subtraction is worth more than addition
		
Mode 2:
	2 x 2 is really silly. Existing apps only go down to 3 x 3.
	Is there enough screen real estate to display two 5 x 5 grids for a vs mode?
		Since they man way to score this is by time, can this be reduced to a beat the clock mode?
